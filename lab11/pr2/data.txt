The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
The early bird catches the worm.
Actions speak louder than words.
Practice makes perfect.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Knowledge is power.
